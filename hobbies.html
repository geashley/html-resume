	<h1>My Hobbies!</h1>
	<p>I love collecting new hobbies :D</p>
	<hr />
	<h2>Learning</h2>
	<h3>Spanish</h3>
	<p>Such a beautiful language. I hope I can become fluent someday</p>
	<h3>Coding</h3>
	<p>One of my priorities right now. Python, web development, and hopefully more!</p>
	<h3>Reading</h3>
	<p>Classics are my favourite but I'm always open to new genres. Currently reading Victor Hugo, Jane Austen, and Charlotte Bronte</p>
	<h3>Journalling</h3>
	<p>Self reflection everyday for a page since I was 12. My journals are my greatest treasures</p>
	<h2>Fashion</h2>
	<h3>Sewing</h3>
	<p>My first sewing project was a Rapunzel dress for Halloween! Now I make everyday clothes, but mostly skirts, dresses, and cute tops.
	</p>
	<h3>Crocheting</h3>
	<p>I've crocheted a couple tops but I also like crocheting stuffed animals and flowers</p>
	<h3>Embroidering</h3>
	<p>Adding small designs is a nice way to personalize an item</p>
	<h2>Music</h2>
	<h3>Singing/songwriting</h3>
	<p>I've been singing since forever and songwriting combines my two favourite things: literature and music</p>
	<h3>Guitar/ukulele and piano</h3>
	<p>My accompaniments to singing! Love piano by itself too <3</p>
	<h3>Violin</h3>
	<p>My primary instrument and the one that started it all</p>
	<h3>Music production</h3>
	<p>Up and coming hobby that I hope to develop</p>
	<h2>Crafts</h2>
	<h3>Origami</h3>
	<p>A very recent addition to my hobbies but one I'm very excited about</p>
